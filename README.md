# eanshl

An iOS application with aim to help logging expenses to http://toshl.com/.

## Usage

Regular case is when you have all barcodes in the database, so you just scan barcode and correct price if needed.
But at first time you have no barcodes, so before sending you should also fill name and tags.
Everything will be remembered so next time you just need to scan and tap “Send”.
